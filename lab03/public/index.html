        <h4>Exercise 3.1</h4><br>
        <p>Node.js and Express.js are two very different things.&nbsp;Node.js is an application interpreter/runtime for Javascript, while Express.js is a library that adds additional niceties on top of Node's capabilities, such as the ability to load in "middleware," use templating engines, and do routing, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;While Node does include somewhat basic HTTP functionality out of the box, Express provides the necessary packages and functions to be able to easily create a webapp server using Node.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The <code>packages.json</code> file is the file used by Node's package manager, NPM, to determine which dependencies need to be installed in order to run your Node app.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to just listing required packages and their versions, the <code>packages.json</code> file also gives some meta information about the package it is included in, such as the version, author, and a description of what the package does.</p>

        <h4>Exercise 3.2</h4><br>
        <p>Static files in the <code>/static</code> directory are files that Node will simply load and then send to the user without any middleware intervention.&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it really easy to have a bunch of Javascript or CSS files that can be easily created and linked to without adding a route for each one.&nbsp;&nbsp;These files are 'static' in the sense that they are not interpreted by Node or a templating engine before being sent to the user, they are just loaded from disk and sent straight to the user without any other interventions by the server&mdash;so, they just don't change.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Well, my server continues to, at <a href="/hello"><code>/hello</code></a>, since I changed the route.  If the <code>static</code> directive had been placed above the routes section, and an <code>index.html</code> file had been placed into the <code>/static</code> folder, then the static file would have trumped the routed text message.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if the route had been placed above the <code>static</code> directive, then the route would have taken precedence over the static files.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Express will choose the first matching route/file when given a choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if I had not changed anything, then no, the text would no longer be displayed.</p>
